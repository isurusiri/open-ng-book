# Nx Extensions   

Let's imagine that you are required to build an application suite or a set of applications that needs to share some common libraries or application logic. Getting things done while making sure everything is in order and up to date is difficult if we are going to use multiple separate projects for each application. This is one core problem that Nx extensions are resolving for ourselves. It enables us to use `monorepo` approach of organizing our applicatioin structure to manage multiple applications with shared logic without coupling them.    

Nx documentation outlines three use cases of Nx extensions which we will explore more in detail later on.    

With Nx, you can:    
-   Use a wider range of framworks.    
-   Use one application codebase for full-stack application development.    
-   Use some of the best software engineering practices battle tested at Google.   

### Angular Cli vs Nx   

Nx is not a replacement for Angular Cli, rather it complements Angular Cli while allowing us to use all of our familiar Angular Cli functionality.
